OMG, just finished Death of a Unicorn and I literally don't even know what to do with myself right now. Like, seriously, WTH was that? 😂 The ending just blew my mind in the weirdest way. It was like they tried to mix a fairy tale with, I don't know, a mid-life crisis or something?! If you haven't already, you've gotta 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and give it a shot. It's weirdly captivating, yet I'm also so confused right now. 

Anyway, can we talk about how they set it up, though? The whole vibe in the beginning was like a mix between a dream and a meme, if memes were actually dreams we'd want to remember. You know what I mean? And the unicorn metaphor, like, did anyone fully get that? Maybe I was just too tired to catch the depth of it, or maybe it’s just random? 

> But dude, the soundtrack!! SO GOOD. It’s like I’m still hearing it, playing on repeat in the back of my mind. Not gonna lie, I had to pause the   just to jam out during that one scene in the forest. It felt like a total vibe shift, you know? And the main character’s ridiculous monologue at the end... IDK if I wanted to laugh or just pretend I was in an artsy   myself, haha. 😂 

Low key wanted to scream when the climax hit, not even because it was shocking but because it felt like they just threw every plot idea they had into a blender and hit the 'random' button. Felt like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 someone try to find their shoes in a blackout—just groping around, hoping for the best. But seriously, you’ve gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ... even if just for the chaos.

setTimeout(() => console.log(Why did I put this here?), 1000);

Anyway, what did you think? Hit me up when you’ve seen it. I swear I need someone to talk this through with. I need answers or maybe just a hug. 😂
